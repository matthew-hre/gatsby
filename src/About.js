        <h1>Symbolism</h1>
        <br />
        <h3>Daisy's dress</h3>
        <p>Throughout the story of The Great Gatsby, Daisy's clothing is symbolic of not only her state in society, but our perception of her in the story.<br /><br />
            In the beginning of the story, we are introduced to Daisy in a beautiful white dress, "They were both in white" (p.13). This white dress is a symbol of purity and innocence.
            Daisy is percieved to be a perfect, pure of heart housewife, in a happy stable relationship with Tom Buchanan.<br /><br />
            Near the end of the story, we can see that Daisy's dress has turned to a shade of yellow. This transition is representative of the reader learning and understanding all of the flaws and facets of Daisy.
            This yellow dress is symbolic of not only infidelity, which we've seen Daisy commit with Gatsby and Tom, but also deceit. Daisy's motive for her scandals with Tom and Gatsby was for the most part, a means to gain wealth, and economic status.<br /><br />
            As we explained in our theme statement, Daisy is a representation of the failed American Dream. Although our dreams may start in a pure, lighthearted state, inevetably they will begin to taint yellow as our motives change. Daisy's motive throughout the story is economic gain, and the accumulation of money; the same concept that the American Dream enforces. 
        </p>
        <h3>Daisy's heart</h3>
        <p>Daisy's heart is not only a symbol of where her romantic interests lie, but her financial interests as well.<br /><br />
        As we see throughout the story, Daisy's love interest switches between Tom and Gatsby, and by association, her personality switches as well. Daisy's economic status comes from associoation with men she is seeing. Throughout the story, we can see her personality shift between more refined and prestigious, with Tom and the East Egg, to more fun-loving and care-free, Gatsby and the West Egg. Her heart is a constant representation of where her loyalties lie, and where her economic status exists.<br />< br />
        This idea is also portrayed in the American Dream. Holding a single job with a single stream of income is not financially feasable, and people who wish to gain economic status need to play all the angles. Not only were scandals traditional in the setting of the book, but also the 1920's themselves. Economic gain is always at the forefront of the American Dream.</p>  
        <h3>Daisy's voice</h3>
        <p>Daisy's voice is the one symbol that stays consistent throughout the story: her money.<br /><br />
        Daisy has always had an association with money, and the means of which she gains money. In chapter 7, Gatsby reveals the thing that was nagging Nick throughout the story: Daisy's voice was full of money. This constant reminder that Daisy's ideals remain constant through the entire story. In every chapter, there is a representation of Daisy's voice, always full of richness and wealth.<br /><br />
        The American Dream has always been a scramble for money, and Daisy's goals have remained the same through the entire novel.
