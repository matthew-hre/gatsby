        <h3>Daisy's dress</h3>
        <p>Throughout the story of The Great Gatsby, Daisy's clothing is symbolic of not only her state in society, but our perception of her in the story.<br /><br />
            In the beginning of the story, we are introduced to Daisy in a beautiiful white dress, "They were both in white" (p.13). This white dress is a symbol of purity and innocence.
            Daisy is percieved to be a perfect, pure of heart housewife, in a happy stable relationship with Tom Buchanan.<br /><br />
            Near the end of the story, we can see that Daisy's dress has turned to a shade of yellow. This transition is representative of the reader learning and understanding all of the flaws and facets of Daisy.
            This yellow dress is symbolic of not only infidelity, which we've seen Daisy commit with Gatsby and Tom, but also deceit. Daisy's motive for her scandals with Tom and Gatsby was for the most part, a means to gain wealth, and economic status.
