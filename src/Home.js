        <h1>Daisy Buchanan</h1>
    
        <p>Daisy is a character who is portrayed as an “ideal” woman, someone who is full of purity and innocence, someone who can do nothing wrong or evil. This portrayal however changes dramatically through the course of the novel. We can see that her “purity” is shown to be in a downward trend and by the end, she is completely opposite of what the reader was led to believe.
        But why did Fitzgerald portray her as the “ideal” woman in the first place? He did so to make the connection between Daisy and the American Dream. Daisy is to Gatsby what the American Dream is to millions of people. Daisy, as a character, is a symbol of that American Dream. The fact that Gatsby wasn't able to get Daisy or “achieve the American Dream” is an effort by Fitzgerald to shed some light on the reality of the American Dream.
        The novel is a criticism of this American Dream. The promise that you can be whoever you want, the cost? Hard Work. <b>NO!</b> No matter how hard you try, there is always going to be a dream that is going to be unattainable, even in relation to the American Dream.

        <p>The American dream has been, and still is, one of the main reasons for people from around the world to move to the west and work to build a better life for themselves and for their family. A promise by the west that if you work hard enough, you’ll be what you wish to be. You’ll achieve what you wish to achieve. But it is imperative for one to know that there are always two sides to a coin. Behind all the glamour, the fun & games, there exists a reality that is encountered by everyone. From the roaring 20s to this day, the American dream is stained by the reality that there are always going to be people with advantages and people with disadvantages. And the American dream will work in favour of those with advantages. This creates an unscalable wall of differences and status that separates these two groups beyond reconciliation. No matter the amount of effort, no matter the amount of hard work put in by the latter group, there can be no true equality. There is always going to be an aspect that would separate them. Fitzgerald portrayed this concept in the novel in a rather mesmerizing manner. As told earlier, Daisy is a direct representation of the American dream in the novel. Each symbol associated with her, from the money in her voice to the purity in her white clothing, represents some aspect of the American dream. 
        As Fitzgerald said, “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.”. </p>
